# FindStuff Mod for Cities: Skylines 2

## Overview
**FindStuff** elevates your Cities: Skylines 2 experience by introducing an advanced mod that streamlines the search and management of game objects. As we continue to refine its features and interface in its alpha phase, FindStuff aims to seamlessly integrate with your gameplay, offering powerful functionalities designed for efficiency and convenience.

## Features

### Enhanced prefab finder and UI Interactivity
- **Unified Interface**: A singular window for easy access to game objects, coupled with an integrated Picker tool for precise selection.
- **Menu Behavior Configuration**: Customize how FindStuff interacts with the game's vanilla menus. Options include:
- **Prefab Selection Memory**: In override mode, if a prefab is selected outside FindStuff when closed, reopening FindStuff will have that prefab pre-selected.
- **Dynamic UI Resizing**: Adjust the FindStuff menu size for an expanded or compact view, enhancing visibility and access to a wider range of assets.
- **Hover menus showing detailed information for prefabs.**
- **Hide FindStuff when a vanilla menu is opened.**
- **Automatic unlock functionality**: Controllable via options menu.
- **Move FindStuff to the top of the screen**: Displaying a compact version, when vanilla menus are active.
- **Override and hide the vanilla asset window**: Replacing it with FindStuff for a unified experience.

### PickStuff tool
- **Easily select prefabs in your city**: Use the droplet tool and easily select your desired prefab, reducing repeating yourself.
- **Integration with FindStuff**: If you have FindStuff to configured to override vanilla prefab/prop menus; PickStuff will automatically highlight it in FindStuff.

### Advanced Search and Filtering Capabilities
- **Optimised for varied hardware**: You have full control of the search speed; which means if you have less capable hardware you can scale back the intensity of searching to lessen the load on your computer.
- **Search indexing and scoring**: Searching is more sophisticated than a direct name match. We use Levenshtein distance algorithim along with a priortisation scoring system to ensure the results most relevant to your search are at the top of the list.
- **Comprehensive Search Options**: Perform full-text searches on asset names, translated names, tags, and categories for precise findings.
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Utilize category and sub-category filters through intuitive icon buttons to streamline your search process.
- **Sorting Functionality**: Order assets by name in ascending or descending format for easier navigation and selection.
- **Autocomplete**: Commonly searched terms are presented if they match your search query as you type it; allowing easy selection.

### Integrated "Plop the Growables" or PloppableRICO support
- **Non-intrusive growables system**
- **You have full control of which buildings are tagged with RICO support**
- **More efficient than other RICO mods as it doesn't process all buildings; only those tagged with our RICO component.**
- **Placing residentials, industrials, commercials and offices directly**
- **Adds the ability to set the buildings "Historical" - means they do not level up/down**
- **Compatibility support for LandValueOverhaul**

### Persistent configuration
- **Don't repeat yourself!**: FindStuff stores your most searched prefabs, last used filtering and view settings so you don't have to repeat the same process whenever you hide/show FindStuff.

### Shortcuts and Language Support
- Leverage shortcuts like CTRL + F for quick searching and CTRL + Click for direct Picker tool access, with customizable options in settings.
- Full language support for all default Cities Skylines 2 locales, ensuring accessibility for a global player base.

### Performance, Optimization, and Configuration
- Experience optimized performance for handling extensive game objects lists, with features to identify potentially harmful objects.
- Enjoy an extended UI developed with the Gooee framework, with configurations remembered and restored on each game load for a seamless experience.

## Usage
Activate FindStuff via the magnifying glass icon or through the HookUI/Gooee mod backpack icon in the upper left corner of the game, the picker tool is accessed through the eye drop icon.
